# MOKE UI

A program to analytically calculate the permittivity tensor $\epsilon$ and different Kerr signals using the eight-directional method.

## Setup

Installing the [required](requirements.txt) python packages via
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Just execute the moke_ui.py file via python and enjoy the UI. Note that the project is unfinished!

## Current problems

+ Equations are not fully simplified using $\Delta G$ and $\Delta H$
+ Sign conventions are not the same as in the literature in all places, especially for the results of the eight-directional method
